Step 1. Cloning the repository.
Open a terminal. Navigate to the root folder you want to clone the respository into. 
Use 'cd <foldername>' to go into a folder and 'cd ..' to go back.
Run the following line:
git clone https://github.com/mkov77/LEAP.git

Step 2. Restoring the backend.
You are going to need to install PostgreSQL. Once it's installed, open PgAdmin4 which
will be installed during the PostgreSQL process. Create a new database called "LEAP". 
This can be done by right clicking a database group on the left navigation bar on PgAdmin4.
Right click your new database and click "Restore...". Where it says "Filename", find
the LEAP.sql file located in the ./Leap/backend folder. Click restore. The tables and 
data should load in.

Step 3. 
Go back to your terminal. Make sure you are in the project folder that you cloned. 
It will be called "LEAP". Run the following line to install all the required dependencies:
npm install
If this doesn't work, you probably dont have npm and to go install it. ChatGPT or google are 
the best resources if this applies.

Step 4. Starting the program.
Go to your file explorer and locate the project folder. At the root of the project folder,
double click to open STARTUP.bat. This will launch the site and the backend.
